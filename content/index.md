I like building cool and beautiful stuff! Experienced in web development (full-stack), android development, Python and C++...with a side specialization in machine learning. 
  
I love solving problems that enable me to build stuff that scales! My areas of interest are time & space complexity optimization, scalable architectures, machine learning and beautiful UI's.
