I love building cool and beautiful stuff! Experienced in web development (full-stack), android development, Python and C++...with a side specialization in deep learning. 
  
When I'm not programming, I'm spending time with my [[family]] or busy on a [[3d printing]] project (probably for my [[keyboard]]!). I also love [[skiing]] and [[tennis]]!
